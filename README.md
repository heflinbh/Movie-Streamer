# Zelda App

In this app I added some of my own flavor to freeCodeCamp.org's very helpful tutorial titled "iOS Development Course - Use Swift 5 and UIKit to Build a Netflix Clone". You can find the link to the tutorial on YouTube here:

I also implimented the Zelda Opensource API, which you can find here:

All pictures in this app I simply downloaded from Google images. If I'm using something improperly let me know and we'll take care of it. 

This app is starting off as more of an "about me" for Zelda games, listing titles and publishing dates, etc. Perhaps soon I will add links to game trailers, or if I'm really ambitious I'll include full walkthroughs. For now I'm just having fun :)
